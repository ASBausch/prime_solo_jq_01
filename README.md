Prime Solo Challenge, Amanda Bausch

Primary objectives of using form data to append the DOM and
create objects have been achieved.
An if/else loop was used with serialized data to append the data to the DOM.
Objects are created from forms serialized data and stored in an array.
The object array logs to the console as they are created by the form.
The objects are not used in appending the DOM, they are stored for 
future use.
